# Config

In order to follow a clean project structure we could place all the configuration files in one common place. This folder is intended to hold files like:

* `.json`
  * map-skin.json
  * ...
* `.xcconfig`
  * Debug.xcconfig
  * Release.xcconfig
  * ...
* `.xcassets`
  * Assets.xccassets
  * ...
* `.plist`
  * Info.plist
  * GoogleService-Info.plist
  * ...

In this folder you can see one approach for this folder contents.
